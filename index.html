        <p class="about-me-paragraph">
          I've always been interested in computers and technology ever since I
          was a teenager. I earned a CompTIA A+ certification when I was 16, and
          took two years of programming courses where I was introduced to Java
          and C++. However life had different plans for me, and immediately
          after high school I secured a great job doing Mineral Title Research
          in the Oil & Gas industry.
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-paragraph">
          Fourteen years later, I had an epiphany that I've never really loved
          any of my previous jobs. They were simply a tool that I used in order
          to make money. I liked various aspects of each job, but I couldn't say
          that I liked doing the actual jobs themselves. I understand that it
          sounds corny, but finally I understood the phrase "if you love what
          you do, then you never work a day in your life".
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-paragraph">
          So I spent two years working full time while learning how to program
          during my spare time. I learned using Udemy, online tutorials, and by
          working on a couple of complex full-stack web applications I built
          from scratch. Since June of 2018, I have been focusing on web
          development as a profession full-time. In addition to freelance work,
          in February of 2019 I enrolled in Lambda School to sharpen my skills
          so that I could focus on becoming the best software engineer I can be.
          Since January of 2020, I have been employed full-time as an Associate
          Software Developer.

          PG Toolbox is an NPM package containing a suite of CLI utility scripts
          which assists programmers manage Postgres databases by providing a
          pattern to define, organize, and execute migration, rollback, truncate
          and seeding scripts. It was created as an alternative to the database
          management features of knex (and other ORMs) in order to promote
          writing pure SQL. I assert that dynamic query builders like knex (and
          other ORMs) are overkill for most use cases, and I wanted to provide a
          useful tool which can be leveraged to learn SQL in a project based
          setting.

          Maze MUD Escape is a multiplayer and interactive maze escape game
          which was made in only a few days for a Lambda School project. We were
          tasked to build out our backend using the Python framework Django,
          which we had never used before. Learning how to learn is one of the
          core tenants of Lambda School's curriculum. Web Workers were leveraged
          for non-blocking rendering of the game on an HTML5 canvas, and Web
          Sockets were utilized in several ways to enhance the multi-player game
          experience.

          ChallengeJS is a JavaScript code challenge web site which was built in
          just one month for a Lambda School project. Running and validating
          arbitrary code which is written client-side proved to be a nice
          challenge. Not only could the code be malicious, but it could also
          have errors and/or stack overflows. We ended up leveraging Web Workers
          in order to run the code client-side, and if the code errored (or
          timed) out, then our application would not come crashing to a halt.
