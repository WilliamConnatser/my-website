        <p class="about-me-paragraph">
          I've always been interested in computers and technology ever since I
          was a teenager. I earned a CompTIA A+ certification when I was 16, and
          took two years of programming courses where I was introduced to Java
          and C++. However life had different plans for me, and immediately
          after high school I secured a great job doing Mineral Title Research
          in the Oil & Gas industry.
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-paragraph">
          Fourteen years later, I had an epiphany that I've never really loved
          any of my previous jobs. They were simply a tool that I used to to
          make money, and I liked various aspects of each job, but I couldn't
          say that I liked doing the actual jobs themselves. It sounds corny,
          but I finally understood the phrase "if you love what you do, then you
          never work a day in your life".
        </p>

        <p class="about-me-paragraph">
          So I spent two years working full time while learning how to program
          during my spare time. I learned using Udemy, online tutorials, and by
          working on a couple of complex full-stack web applications I built
          from scratch. Since June of 2018, I have been focusing on web
          development full-time. In addition to freelance work, in February of
          2019 I enrolled in Lambda School to sharpen my self-taught skills so
          that I could focus on becoming the best software engineer I can be.
          Since January 2020, I have been employed full-time as an Associate
          Software Developer.

          ChallengeJS is a JavaScript code challenge web site which was built in
          just one month for a Lambda School project. Running and validating
          arbitrary code which is written client-side proved to be a nice
          challenge. Not only could the code be malicious, but it could also
          have errors and/or stack overflows. We ended up leveraging Web Workers
          in order to run the code client-side, and if the code errored (or
          timed) out, then our application would not come crashing to a halt.

          Stockly helps you make informative decisions as to whether you should
          buy, sell or hold equities based off of analysis from a machine
          learning model. Save stocks to your favorites, or view recent values
          and price movements. This project was built in only a few days with a
          small group of Lambda School students. I was solely responsible for
          the backend of this project. One of the engineering challenges I faced
          was dealing with rate limit issues with the AlphaVantage API, so I
          created a database table to cache price data to reduce API calls.
